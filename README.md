  I'm a last-grade student at the Technical School in the IT specialization. Additionally, I'm a junior Python Developer with a strong motivation to transition into a Data Analyst role. I'm interested in Music, Programming, and AI-based tools. I mainly program in Python and have experience with web technologies (HTML, JS, PHP).
	 
 On my profile, you will find mainly Python-based projects related to data processing.
